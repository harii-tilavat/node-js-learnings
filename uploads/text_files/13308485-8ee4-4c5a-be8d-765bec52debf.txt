What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is
used for storing and managing data in Relational
Database Management System (RDBMS).
It is a standard language for Relational Database
System. It enables a user to create, read, update
and delete relational databases and tables.
All the RDBMS like MySQL, Informix, Oracle, MS
Access and SQL Server use SQL as their standard
database language.
SQL allows users to query the database in a
number of ways, using English-like statements.

What are the SQL?
SQL follows the following rules:
Structure query language is not case sensitive. Generally,
keywords of SQL are written in uppercase.
Statements of SQL are dependent on text lines. We can
use a single SQL statement on one or multiple text line.
Using the SQL statements, you can perform most of the
actions in a database.
SQL depends on tuple relational calculus and relational
algebra.

What is SQL Process?
When an SQL command is executing for any RDBMS,
then the system figure out the best way to carry out
the request and the SQL engine determines that how
to interpret the task.
In the process, various components are included.
These components can be optimization Engine, Query
engine, Query dispatcher, classic, etc.
All the non-SQL queries are handled by the classic
query engine, but SQL query engine won't handle
logical files.

What is SQL Process?

Query Language Processor	Parser+Optimizer

	File Manager

	Transaction Manager

Physical Database

What is Advantages of SQL?
High speed

●	No coding needed
Well defined standards
Portability
Interactive language
Multiple data view

What is SQL Datatype?
SQL Datatype is used to define the values that a
column can contain.
Every column is required to have a name and data
type in the database table.

SQL Datatype

Binary	Numeric	Extract Numeric	String	Date
Datatype	Datatype	Datatype	Datatype	Datatype

SQL Commands
SQL commands are instructions. It is used to
communicate with the database. It is also used to
perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data.

SQL can perform various tasks like create a table, add
data to tables, drop the table, modify the table, set
permission for users.

Types of SQL Commands
There are five types of SQL commands: DDL, DML,
DCL, TCL, and DQL.
SOL Command

DDL	DML	DCL	TCL	DQL

Create	Insert	Grant	Commit	Select

Drop	Update	Revoke	Rollback

Alter	Delete	Save
	point
Truncate

Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a
table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc.
All the command of DDL are auto-committed that
means it permanently save all the changes in the
database.
Here are some commands that come under DDL:
> CREATE
➤ ALTER
DROP
TRUNCATE

Data Definition Language (DDL)- CREATE
CREATE It is used to create a new table in the database.

Syntax:
REATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (COLUMN_NAME DATATYPES[,....]);

Example:
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHA
R2(100), DOB DATE);

Data Definition Language (DDL)- Drop
Drop: It is used to delete both the structure and record
stored in the table.

Syntax:
DROP TABLE ;

Example:
DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE;

Data Definition Language (DDL)- ALTER
ALTER: It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change
could be either to modify the characteristics of an existing
attribute or probably to add a new attribute.

Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name COLUMN-definition;
	-
ALTER TABLE MODIFY (COLUMN DEFINITION....);

Example:
ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));
ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS MODIFY (NAME VARCHAR2(20));

Data Definition Language (DDL)- TRUNCATE
TRUNCATE: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free
the space containing the table.

Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

Example:
TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEE;

Data Manipulation Language
DML commands are used to modify the database. It is
responsible for all form of CHANGES in the database.
The command of DML is not auto-committed that
means it can't permanently save all the changes in the
database. They can be rollback.

Here are some commands that come under DML:
INSERT
➤ UPDATE
DELETE
